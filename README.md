# 1.	Summary
   
The project revolves around exploring the expansion of Eniac, an online marketplace specializing in Apple-compatible accessories, to the Brazilian market.
To do so, Eniac wants to analyze the feasibility of collaborating with Magist, which is a Brazilian SaaS that offers a centralized order management system to connect small and medium-sized stores with the Biggest Brazilian marketplaces. Moreover, Magist provides after- sales services such as stock and warehouse management. 
Eniac wants to evaluate Magist on the following two main concerns:

•	Whether Magist is a good partner for high-end tech products that constitue 100% of Eniac’s catalogue.

•	Whether Magist provides fast delivery.

As a Data Scientist, I have explored Magist Database to come up with answers and recommendations to Eniac’s concerns.
